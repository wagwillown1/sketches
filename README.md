# Sketches

A minimal two-page static site for drafting and testing ideas.

## Run locally

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repository (for example `sketches`) and push this code to the `main` branch.
2. In GitHub, open **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Source**, choose the `main` branch and the **root** folder, then click **Save**.
4. Wait for the green **Pages** banner to show the live URL (usually `https://<username>.github.io/sketches/`).
5. Visit the URL to confirm both `index.html` and `ideas.html` load correctly. All links and assets use relative paths, so the site works from the `/sketches` subpath.

## Updating the live site

1. Make changes locally and commit them.
2. Push to the `main` branch.
3. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild; refresh the live URL to see updates.
1. Push to the `main` branch.
2. In GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Select the `main` branch and the **root** folder, then save.
4. Your site will be available at the GitHub Pages URL (works from the `/sketches` subpath thanks to relative links).
