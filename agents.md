# Agent Instructions (Sketches)

You are operating as a coding agent inside this repository.

## Project goal
This repo is called **Sketches** and is used as a fast, low-friction playground to draft ideas, test UI concepts, and publish simple web experiments.

The priority is **speed + clarity**, not enterprise processes.

---

## Non-negotiable workflow rules (SOLO REPO)
- **DO NOT create branches.**
- **DO NOT open Pull Requests.**
- **DO NOT request reviews.**
- **ALL changes must be committed directly to `main`.**
- Keep commits small and frequent.

If you believe a change is risky, make a smaller change and commit it first (still on `main`).

---

## Git workflow (required)
Before making changes:
1. Ensure we are on `main`
2. Pull latest

Use this exact pattern:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
